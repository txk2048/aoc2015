# Advent Of Code 2015

Here are my solutions to [Advent Of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

# Run a solution

You need to have Rust and Cargo installed to run the following command.

To run a solution for a given day, run the following command from within the project directory, substituting X for the number of the day.

```shell
$ cargo run --bin dayX <PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE>
```

The input file format is usually just the raw input from Advent of Code pasted as-is, but occasionally may be a JSON file, in which case you can easily get the format from looking through the code for that day.
